<h5 style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 10%; line-height: 1.6"><b>What is e-government</b></h5>

<h6 style="text-align: justify; margin-right: 10%; margin-left: 10%; line-height: 1.6"> E-government has been employed to mean everything from ‘online government services’’ to ‘exchange of information and services electronically with citizens, businesses, and other arms of government’. Traditionally, e-government has been considered as the use of ICTs for improving the efficiency of government agencies and providing government services online. Later, the framework of e-government has broadened to include use of ICT by government for conducting a wide range of interactions with citizens and businesses as well as open government data and use of ICTs to enable innovation in governance.
E-government can thus be defined as the use of ICTs to more effectively and efficiently deliver government services to citizens and businesses. It is the application of ICT in government operations, achieving public ends by digital means.  The underlying principle of e-government, supported by an effective e-governance institutional framework, is to improve the internal workings of the public sector by reducing financial costs and transaction times so as to better integrate work flows and processes and enable effective resource utilization across the various public sector agencies aiming for sustainable solutions. Through innovation and e-government, governments around the world can be more efficient, provide better services, respond to the demands of citizens for transparency and accountability, be more inclusive and thus restore the trust of citizens in their governments (United Nations, 2018).</h6>
